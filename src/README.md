Build notes

## libuv

The contents of the libuv/ directory are the canonical libuv sources, with the following changes.

In libuv/, run `./autogen.sh`. This requires automake and libtool, and generates the `configure` script, along with a number of other related files. These generated files are checked into the repository so that other systems to not need automake and libtool to build libuv.

The file `libuv/m4/lt~obsolete.m4` (generated by autogen.sh) is renamed to `lt_obsolete.m4` because the filename with the `~` causes problems with `R CMD check`. In the Makevars file, it gets copied to `lt~obsolete.m4` so that it's present during the build process.

In Makevars, before running `./configure`, it touches `Makefile.in`, `aclocal.m4`, and `configure`. If this is not done, then the configure script may generate a Makefile which tries to find `aclocal-1.15` and other autotools-related programs. It decides whether to do this based on file timestamps. See this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33278928/how-to-overcome-aclocal-1-15-is-missing-on-your-system-warning-when-compilin) for more information.

The following generated files are checked into the repository:
