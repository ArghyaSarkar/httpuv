Type: Package
Title: HTTP and WebSocket server library
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2013-02-26
Author: RStudio, Inc.
Maintainer: Joe Cheng <joe@rstudio.com>
Description: httpuv provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling
  HTTP and WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is primarily intended
  as a building block for other packages, rather than making it particularly
  easy to create complete web applications using httpuv alone. httpuv is built
  on top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of which were developed
  by Joyent, Inc.
